# Network_Stats_Tray_Utility
Some quick code mostly functional to help contribute to an /r/sysadmin request for assitance.

The good:
Application installs and components that do not require external service providers are functional.

Required Improvements:
There is a general lack of error handling and dialog box display issues in some fields when a test fails or other
unexpected output ocours. This needs to be improved.

Additiionaly 3rd party services for ISP detection, upload/download speed calculation, and other reamining checks
need to be found. These functions are not compleated as I do not want to provide a globaly accessable server
infrastructure for thes components to work. However a user of this script could pay for / provide these service
points for their own users fairly easily.

General Notice:

This is not ment to be production code, functional product, or even a personal project of mine. This was created
and distrubted as a rough framework for a /r/sysadmin request to get another reddit user well on their way.
This code is provided for free, with no warrenties, nor provieded as a example of my own professional code qualites.
